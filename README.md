# npm-git-behind-firewall
windows batch file to set up npm and git behind corporate firewall

## Reasons for this
The excellent npm script at https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools works perfectly on a windows installation if you have administrative rights and no corporate firewall. In my work environment I could not get it to work.
